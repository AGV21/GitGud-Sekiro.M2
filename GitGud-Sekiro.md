Design Reasons: 
* The font style (Tiro Gurmukhi) is a nice font that matches the theme of the game (at least to me). 
* The colors are seen at the main menu and title screen within the game “Sekrio: Shadows Die Twice”. The game is filled with Black and this shade of brown throughout the game along with white and red. 
* Putting the title of the game in the middle of “Git” and “Gud” is more of a stylistic choice, nothing more. 
* The tabs for “Bosses” and “Endings” are placed next to the name of the website at the top to be symmetric.
* Screenshot from the game as the background so the site does not look boring.
* All text will be in a black box that is a little transparent so the site users can read the text easily while also not disturbing the background image.
